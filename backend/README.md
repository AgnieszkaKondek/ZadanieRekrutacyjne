# Backend
## Express
## NestJS
## Spring Boot + Java
## Spring Boot + Kotlin

In this directory you'll find backend starters for the application. You can choose any technology you like, but we've provided couple of starters in different technologies to help get you up and running.

## What we expect from you?

Build simple API that uses https://www.weatherapi.com/ to show current weather in 2 cities: Gliwice and Hamburg. The application can be built using any technology you like. 
You should expose at least 2 endpoints:
1. `/realtime-weather` - should return current weather in Gliwice and Hamburg
2. `/forecast-weather` - should return forecast for next days in Gliwice and Hamburg
   
Those are basic requirements, but feel free to add more features if you like.

## Guidelines for backend:

1. Clean and readable code (don't get too fancy, we're looking for clean and readable code)
2. Usage of modern backend technologies
3. Usage of best practices (we want to see how you structure your code)
4. Usage of version control system (git)
5. Usage of provided API (we want to see how you use it)
6. Saving data in a database or in runtime (we want to see how you handle data)
8. Instructions on how to run the application (we want to see your application in action)
+ 9. Bonus points for testing
